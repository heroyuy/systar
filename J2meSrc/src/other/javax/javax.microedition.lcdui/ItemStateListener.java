	 * Called when internal state of an <code>Item</code> has been

	 * This happens when the user:
	 * <UL>
	 * <LI>changes the set of selected values in a
	 * <code>ChoiceGroup</code>;</LI>
	 * <LI>adjusts the value of an interactive <code>Gauge</code>;</LI>
	 * <LI>enters or modifies the value in a <code>TextField</code>;</LI>

	 * <p> It is up to the device to decide when it considers a
	 * new value to have been entered into an <code>Item</code>.  For example,
	 * implementations of text editing within a <code>TextField</code>
	 * vary greatly
	 * from device to device. </P>
	 * 
	 * <p>In general, it is not expected that the listener will be called
	 * after every change is made. However, if an item's value
	 * has been changed, the listener
	 * will be called to notify the application of the change
	 * before it is called for a change on another item, and before a
	 * command is delivered to the <code>Form's</code>
	 * <code>CommandListener</code>. For implementations that have the
	 * concept of an input
	 * focus, the listener should be called no later than when the focus moves
	 * away from an item whose state has been changed.  The listener
	 * should be called only if the item's value has actually been
	 * changed.</P>
	 * 
	 * <p> The listener is not called if the application changes
	 * the value of an interactive item. </p>
	 * 
	 * @param item - the item that was changed
